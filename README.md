I never planned on doing computer science; I always pictured myself as a counsellor or someone in a quiet, ordinary job, because of something that stayed true to me always: "empathy". That instinct is still rooted in me, and I wish I could have studied psychology. Even though I have to learn so much here and there, I'm trying to keep up with the things I really like "now".

Currently, I'm interested in understanding randomness. {Hoping that the project be born}

My notebooks live at <a href="https://reflection.amals.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflection</a>.

You can also visit my drafted portfolio at the profile link to the left of this README. I'm keeping time to update the works there and vanishing sections like "Anthropology."

I keep things simple until they can’t be. In the same thought, I made these projects:
- <a href="https://golang.amals.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golangdocs</a>
- <a href="https://kutt27.github.io/finance-encyclopedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finance-encyclopedia</a>

If you have time, check it out. Like / improvements? Reach out to me, I love to connect with new faces.

I'm also trying to get into web3 {side projects}. You can see my current projects [here](https://github.com/kutt27).
