CS is my favorite subject by accident. I had so much to learn here and there, so trying hard to keep up with the things that I really like. Currently I'm interested in understanding randomness.

I do write my own blogs at [Reflection](reflection.amals.xyz). 

Also you can visit my drafted portfolio at the profile link to the left of this readme. I'm keeping my time to update the works their and dropping some sections from portfolio like "Anthropology".

I don't like making things complicated until it breaks down. In the same philosophy I made these projects [golangdocs](https://golang.amals.xyz/) and [finance-encyclopedia](https://kutt27.github.io/finance-encyclopedia/). So if you have time, check it out. Liked / improvements => you can reach me at my email given below. Love to connect with new faces. 

I also trying to get into web3 {side projects}. You can see my current project [here](https://github.com/kutt27).
